## Our Plan for the ARXEN Codebase

We've identified the ARXEN construction website codebase as an excellent foundation for our new TJ Flooring website. Here's our plan:

1. **Why ARXEN works for us:**
   - The existing site has a robust React/TypeScript architecture
   - It already includes flooring services pages we can expand upon
   - The estimate request form can be easily modified for our specific services
   - The portfolio display system is perfect for showcasing our flooring projects
   - The responsive design works well across all devices

2. **Our transformation approach:**
   - Rebrand all elements to reflect TJ Flooring's identity
   - Focus the content on our core flooring and bathroom remodeling services
   - Simplify the navigation to highlight what we do best
   - Update all contact information and location details
   - Enhance SEO for flooring-specific keywords

3. **Technical requirements:**
   - We'll need to set up new EmailJS credentials for form submissions
   - Update Google Maps API for our location
   - Configure analytics for the new site
   - Set up hosting on Vercel or similar platform

We've already created a comprehensive transformation plan document that outlines the specific changes needed, files to modify, and a timeline for implementation. Our goal is to launch the new TJ Flooring website within 5 weeks, providing our customers with an intuitive, professional online presence that accurately represents our services and quality standards.
